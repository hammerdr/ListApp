# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

Using ruby 3.0.0 with rbenv

* System dependencies

If you can install nokogiri you're probably good! You can do that with

```
bundle install
```

* Database creation

```
bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

* How to run the test suite

```
bundle exec rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
bundle exec rspec
```
